## What is R?

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is a user interface for R. You download it separately, but it's a "nicer" way to work in R. 

RStudio (the company) currently:

- Develops and freely provides the RStudio IDE
- Provides excellent resources for learning and using R (cheatsheets, )
- Is producing some of the most-used R packages
- Employees some of the top people in R development

## Setting up

If do not already have them, you will need to download and install both R and RStudio. 

- Go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) and download the latest version of R for your system. Install.
- Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and download the latest version of RStudio for your system. Install. 
- Defaults should be fine for everything.
